Multiselect Custom Field
========================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/call-learning/moodle-customfield_multiselect.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/call-learning/moodle-customfield_multiselect)


This plugin is a new multiselect profile inspired from the existing select customfield (customfield/field/select)

It allows for several choices to be selected.
The data is stored in the database as comma separated values of option indexes.


Still work in progress.


TODO
====
 * Allow to change the select into a series of cheboxes for small amounts of choices.
 * When values are removed from the list, should we re-index ?
