* Methods \core_customfield\handler::get_field_config_form() and \core_customfield\handler::setup_edit_page() are no
  longer used. Components that define custom fields areas do not need to implement them. Field edit form opens in
  the modal now.

=== 4.0 ===
The way the method customfield_multiselect\data_controller::get_value() was returning an array was causing multiple issues with core AJAX functionality returning course data. 
Examples of somewhere this error was occuring is when trying to duplicate a course via 'manage courses and categories', or when trying to fetch a list of courses when adding a meta link enrolment method. 
Issues also occured when using Edwiser Bridge. 
The solution was to return a string of values using get_value, but preparing the data as an array when using the course edit form.
